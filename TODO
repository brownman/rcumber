KNOWN BUGS
------------
* Not displaying stderr in test results - Need a tighter way to run than using system() ?
* Not handling creating a new test with the same name as an existing test - currently overwrites
* need to improve field checking, error handling and help on creation screen - it's confusing - do they really need to manage the filename?

ROADMAP / UPCOMING FEATURES 
----------------
* Show all tests next to the current test for faster navigation.
* Create a demo/home site at radsoft.com where people can play with this plugin
* Add some screen shots to the home site
* Graphical commander panel to run and show the red/green
* Run all tests or a selected set of tests at once
* Click on a stack trace in the results and navigate to textmate
* Extract user configurable parameters into a ./config file
* Integrate some relevant 3rd party agile articles/blogs on story tests and cucumber using a feed from radsoft.com (user definable).
