Pasted from the "wiki" at http://github.com/jgoodsen/rcumber/wikis Home Page:

rcumber is a rails plugin that lets your customers view, edit and run Cucumber tests directly from your rails project.

h2. Three Step Installation

It's simple to use - just add it as a plugin to your project:

<pre>
   cd ./vendor/plugins
   git clone git://github.com/jgoodsen/rcumber.git
</pre>

Step two:  just start your rails server and visit http://localhost:3000/rcumber

Step three: Oh, there is no step three!

h2. This is just a first cut of my idea.

The current release is just a first cut hack at my idea.  See the [[User Story Backlog]] for immediate features I'm planning to implement and checkout the [[Product Roadmap]] for a larger picture of more features we want to add.  I'm looking for some help - if you're interested, please contact me.
