Rcumber
============
This is a simple rails plugin that provides a web interface to view, edit and run Cucumber story tests in your rails project.
I am designing it for use on our current projects with the idea that our customers can help us specify customer tests in Rcumber.

I just started it a few days ago, but it's already functional, so I'll put it up here on GitHub for the rest of the world to
help me make it better.

Installation
============
Grab it from git-hub, add it as a plugin. 

Example
=======
Start your server and visit http://localhost:3000/rcumber.  The UI should be self explanatory.

Release Notes:
=============
rcumber-0.1:  Initial port into github
