h2. Overview of rcumber

Rcumber is a rails plugin that lets your customers view, edit and run Cucumber tests directly from your rails project.

First you need to have "rspec":http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/tree/master, "rspec-on-rails":http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails/tree/master and "Cucumber":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree/master installed and you'll need to have some cucumber tests written in your project.

h2. Current Features

You can list all your Cucumber tests, click on a test to see it, edit it, save it back to your project and run it.  Coming next is:

* ability to create/delete cucumber stories
* better graphical feedback on a test run
* structured editing of a cucumber test
* subversion and git integration for auto-commit of story test updates

See the [[User Story Backlog]] for immediate features I'm planning to implement and checkout the [[Product Roadmap]] for a larger picture of more features we want to add.  I'm looking for some help - if you're interested, please contact me.

h2. Installation

If you're looking at this right now - it's only been a day since I've pulled this out of a project (and I'm still a newbie at building my own plugin) - and there's some kinks - here they are - any help would be appreciated!:

h3. Add to your routes

You need to add the following to your routes.rb until I figure out how to bootstrap this in the plugin init process:

<pre> 
map.rcumber 'rcumber', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'index' 
map.resources :rcumbers do |rcumber|
  rcumber.run 'run', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'run'
end
</pre>

It's simple to add rcumber to your rails project - just install it as plugin into your project:

<pre>
   cd ./vendor/plugins
   git clone git://github.com/jgoodsen/rcumber.git
   rake rcumber:install  <-- all this does is copy the nifty cucumber.gif to your /images directory
</pre>

Step two:  just start your rails server and visit http://localhost:3000/rcumber

That's it!  You should be looking at your cool cukes through a sexy web interface.
