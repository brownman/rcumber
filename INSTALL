INSTALLATION
------------

	- Add rcumber as a plugin to your project (clone it from github in your vendor/plugins directory).

	- Add to your routes:
	
  map.rcumber 'rcumber', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'index'
  map.rcumber_runall 'rcumber/runall', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'runall'
  map.rcumber_runmany 'rcumber/run_many', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'run_many'
  map.resources :rcumbers do |rcumber|
    rcumber.run 'run', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'run'
  end
		
	- Copy ui/rcumber.gif to the /images directory in your project - recommended for now
		(until I learn how to intercept requests to "/images" from a plugin...)
	
	- Copy ui/rcumber.css to your /stylesheets directory - recommend for now
		(until I learn how to intercept requests to "/stylesheets" from a plugin...)
