INSTALLATION
------------

	- Add rcumber as a plugin to your project (clone it from github in your vendor/plugins directory).

	- Add to your routes:
	
			map.rcumber 'rcumber', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'index' 
		  map.rcumber_icon 'rcumber_icon', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'rcumber_icon '  
		  map.resources :rcumbers do |rcumber|
		    rcumber.run 'run', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'run'
		  end
		
	- Copy ui/rcumber.gif to the /images directory in your project - recommended for now
		(until I learn how to intercept requests to "/images" from a plugin...)
	
	- Copy ui/rcumber.css to your /stylesheets directory - recommend for now
		(until I learn how to intercept requests to "/stylesheets" from a plugin...)
