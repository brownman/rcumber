INSTALLATION
------------

	- Generate RSpec Files -- You will need rspec and rspec-rails installed -- 
	  (This is recommend but optional unless you wish to run the specs for this plugin)
	
	./script/generate spec
	
	-Generate Cucumber Files -- You will need cucumber and cucumber rails installed --
	 (Required)
	  
	./script/generate cucumber
	
	- Add rcumber as a plugin to your project
	
	cd vendor/plugins
	git clone git://github.com/jrwest/rcumber.git 

	- Add to your routes:
	
  map.rcumber 'rcumber', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'index'
  map.rcumber_runall 'rcumber/runall', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'runall'
  map.rcumber_runmany 'rcumber/run_many', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'run_many'
  map.resources :rcumbers do |rcumber|
    rcumber.run 'run', :controller => 'rcumbers', :action => 'run'
  end
		
	- Copy ui/rcumber.gif to the /images directory in your project - recommended for now
		(until I learn how to intercept requests to "/images" from a plugin...)
	
	- Copy ui/rcumber.css to your /stylesheets directory - recommend for now
		(until I learn how to intercept requests to "/stylesheets" from a plugin...)
